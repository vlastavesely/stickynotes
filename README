Sticky Notes for Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a program that simulates the Sticky Notes for the Mate Desktop
Environment. From the user's perspective, it works the same way as the Mate
applet: it allows you to create, view, and maintain sticky notes on your
desktop. However, under the hood, there are some changes:

  - independent on MATE Desktop
  - does not resize the notes when the text is too long (forces scrolling instead)
  - highlights selected text properly
  - has ability to perform some basic synchronisation (using GSettings)
